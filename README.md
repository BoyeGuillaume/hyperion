# Hyperion
Hyperion is a framework for analyzing and transforming logical programs into optimized, potentially distributed versions. It provides tools for reasoning about program equivalence, optimizing code, and ensuring correctness through formal methods.

## Documentation

The documentation for Hyperion can be found through the `cargo doc` command after building the project. It provides detailed information about the modules, functions, and structures available in Hyperion.

Some additional documentation is available in the `docs/` directory of the repository, including nomenclature and design decisions. See [docs/Introduction.md](docs/Introduction.md) for more information about internal terminology.
